Data:
• Choice: integer – Based on the option that the user selects from the menu.
• File/Picture: 2D Array – using values from a file.
• Crop: size – allows edits to the size of the array based on the users input
• Save: array of ints – saved in file

Program:
This program will allow a user to select from a menu in which will allow them to display an
image using the values of a specified file. In this menu, the image that is selected to load can be
edited by the user, allowing them to edit the values, crop the size, dim and brighten the image, as
well as rotate the image. After the user has been satisfied with editing their image, using the
options from the menu, they will have the option to save new image either into the existing file
that the image is from or they are able to choose a different file by entering in the file name. after
this, the program will loop back to the beginning menu until the user decides to quit/exit the
program.

Functions:
main()
Data: Array for image selected by user. Integer Variables for menu options.
Functionality: Loads the menu to the user. Displays image from users file selection. Displays
any edits made by the user by displaying the updated image. In a loop, displays the editing menu,
along with the option to save to file. Checks for exit by the user.

loadImage()
Input Parameters: File pointer, char 2D Array,
Returned Output: none
Functionality: This function will loop display a menu, allowing the user to input the filename of
their image. This then allows the program to initialize the specified file. This will convert or plug
in the values from the file into our 2D Array.

displayImage()
Input Parameters: File pointer, char 2D Array, int size
Returned Output: None
Functionality: This function initializes the row and column of our 2D array. From this, it prints
“image” followed by the print of the array using the iteration of the 2D array.

editImage()
Input Parameters: char 2D Array, int size
Returned Output: None
Functionality: This function loop displays an edit menu in which allows the user to crop, dim,
brighten, save, return to the main menu, or quit their image. The loop will continue as long as
user does not opt to return to the main menu or quit out of the program. Any other option will
then ask them for needed values to edit their image, then loop back to see if the user would like
to continue editing or save their file.

cropImage()
Input Parameters: char 2D Array, int size, file pointer
Returned Output: None
Functionality: This function will ask the user to specify which coordinates they would like to
crop in or out. We'll ask for a top left coordinate and a bottom right coordinate. Based off of which coordinates the user inputs, it will update the size of the image by creatating a buffer array then putting the new values in by replacing the original array.Then it will ask if the user would like to display their cropped image.

dimImage()
Input Parameters: char 2D Array, int size, file pointer
Returned Output: None
Functionality: This function will prompt the user and ask them how much they would like to
dim their image on a scale of -1 to -4. Based off of what the user inputs, it will update each pixel
(character value) of the image. This will then display the updated image.

brightenImage()
Input Parameters: char 2D Array, int size, file pointer
Returned Output: None
Functionality: This function will prompt the user and ask them how much they would like to
brighten their image on a scale of 1 to 4. Based off what the user inputs, it will update each pixel
(character value) of the image. This will then display the updated image.

rotateImage_90()
Input Parameters: char 2D Array, int size, file pointer
Returned Output: None
Functionality: creates a new empty image, then switches the values for rows into columns and
columns into rows. Iterates the values from the users file putting each value into its new position
on the array. Displays new image.
